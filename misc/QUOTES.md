Here are some quotes that may reflect why privacy is important and why you should always choose going **the private way**:

> Running a self-hosted live stream server can be done for as cheap as $5/mo, and that’s a much better deal than selling your soul to Facebook, Google or Amazon. ― [Owncast](https://owncast.online/about/)

Companies that diminish and weaken our privacy are not our friends:
> “Friends don’t spy; true friendship is about privacy, too.” ― Stephen King

> Historically, privacy was almost implicit, because it was hard to find and gather information. But in the digital world, whether it's digital cameras or satellites or just what you click on, we need to have more explicit rules - not just for governments but for private companies. ― Bill Gates

> Privacy isn't negotiable.

> The primary reason for window curtains in our house, is to stop people from being able to see in. The reason we don’t want them to see in is because we consider much of what we do inside our homes to be private. Whether that be having dinner at the table, watching a movie with your kids, or even engaging in intimate or sexual acts with your partner. None of these things are illegal by any means but even knowing this, we still keep the curtains and blinds on our windows. We clearly have this strong desire for privacy when it comes to our personal life and the public. - Joshua

> Ultimately, saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. Or that you don't care about freedom of the press because you don't like to read. Or that you don't care about freedom of religion because you don't believe in God. Or that you don't care about the freedom to peacably assemble because you're a lazy, antisocial agoraphobe. - Edward Snowden

> Without strong encryption, you will be spied on systematically by lots of people. - Whitfield Diffie

> If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy. - [Phil Zimmermann](http://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html)
