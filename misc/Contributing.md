# Contributing Guide

## Pull Requests

If you are familiar you can add a *section* or a *service* yourself via **pull request**. This is the better way.

If you are not familiar with Github and PRs you can open a new issue and explain what you want to add there.

### Adding a new section
To add a new section copy the following template and complete with the information:

```
## Section Title

<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> **Avoid**

[OPTIONAL EXPLANATION OF WHY THESE SERVICES ARE BAD]

- Bad Service 1
- Bad Service 2
- Bad Service 3

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img>  **Instead use**

[OPTIONAL EXPLANATION OF WHY THESE SERVICES ARE GOOD]

- [Good Service 1](https://link-to-source-or-page1) - Little description of the service.
- [Good Service 2](https://link-to-source-or-page2) - Little description of the service.
- [Good Service 2](https://link-to-source-or-page3) - Little description of the service.
```
You also need to add the section to the **Table of Contents (Contents)** at the top of the document:

`- [Section Title](#section-title)`

### Adding a new service

To add a new service just take the following template and add it to the section where it belongs:

`- [Service Name](https://link-to-source-or-page) - Little description of the service`

> You can add either a *good* (use) or a *bad* (avoid) service.
