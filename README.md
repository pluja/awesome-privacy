This may include not only the content of your requests but also metadata, such as timestamps or IP addresses. Third-party servers may grant access to your data to their employees, partners, or even other users, depending on their privacy policies. Data may be used for various purposes, including model training, research, or even marketing activities.

## Design Tools

**Adobe**'s dominance in design tools restricts designers' choices and compromises their privacy. Its [lack of Linux support](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/download-install/kb/operating-system-guidelines.html), confines designers to Windows or macOS. Plus, Adobe's [data collection via Creative Cloud](https://tosdr.org/en/service/417) and [trackers](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.adobe.psmobile/latest/) further amplifies privacy concerns. They also may be [using users' work to train their AIs](https://mastodon.art/@Krita/109632425661190494), potentially causing intellectual property problems.

## Operating Systems
### Android
‚õî Try to avoid using Google Android or any Android that has been modified and tuned by any manufacturer such as Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung, etc. Android is an Open Source project - [AOSP - Android Open Source Project]() - and it has many versions that will respect the user privacy and data and won't share it with private servers from manufacturers or service providers.

‚úÖ **Instead use**

> [!NOTE]
> **Android app compatibility**:
> Although all of these Operating Systems are Android, app compatibility may not be perfect due to a lack of GMS (Google Mobile Services) which some apps require. You can check how well apps work with microg (a free and open source alternative to GMS) or no GMS at all with [Plexus](https://plexus.techlore.tech/) where the community can report how well android apps perform in those environments.

> [!NOTE]
> **Android security**: Custom ROMs can improve your privacy the same as they can decrease the Android security, always use ROMs that support verified boot and encryption and **DO NOT** have root enabled by default. If possible, don't use userdebug builds. If your threat model requires security, buy a Google Pixel and install GrapheneOS on it. [Read more on PrivacyGuides](https://www.privacyguides.org/android/overview).

#### Android-Based

**GrapheneOS** has a strong focus on security and privacy. It deploys technologies to mitigate many vulnerabilities and makes exploiting of vulnerabilities substantially more difficult. It improves the security of both the OS and the apps running on it.

- [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) - GrapheneOS is an open source privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility. Only **Google Pixel** phones are supported.

These ROMs also offer good priavcy and/or extended support for a wider range of devices. Note that these may also reduce security, increasing the attack surface of the operating system.

- [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) - Privacy by Design ROM. Offers better security than LineageOS or Replicant.

### Smart TV
‚õî Don't use Google's Android TV, LG WebOS or any other privacy-invasive common TV OS that comes preinstalled with your TV.

‚úÖ **Instead use**

Currently I am not aware of any privacy-respecting smartTV software. If you are aware of any, please open a Pull Request or an issue.

The following software is not an **Operating System** but comprises apps that can be used on almost any OS. These apps respect your privacy and offer features similar to those of a Smart TV. A recommended setup involves connecting a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) running a GNU/Linux operating system to your TV, installing tools like [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) to control media from your phone, and then adding the apps listed below:

- [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) - It is an entertainment hub that brings all your digital media together into a beautiful and user friendly package. It is 100% free and open source, very customisable and runs on a wide variety of devices.

‚úÖ **Instead use**
#### [GNU/Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/)

> [!TIP]
>  If you want to try it out without installing it to your computer, you can use a [Live USB Stick](https://www.fosslinux.com/274/how-to-create-linux-mint-live-usb-drive-on-windows.htm). You can also investigate [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net) to easily download and test linux distros with a USB stick.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to install Linux but keep your current operating System, you can set up [dual boot](https://averagelinuxuser.com/dualboot-linux-windows/).

> [!NOTE]
> Not all Linux distributions are free (as in freedom), free (as in free beer) or respect user privacy. There are tons of GNU/Linux distributions and you should investigate a bit before jumping into one of them!

#### Other OS:

- [AtlasOS](https://atlasos.net/) - An open-source modification of Windows 10, designed to optimize performance, and latency. Atlas removes all types of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection.

## Social Networks and Platforms

> [!NOTE]
> **The fediverse**
>
> The fediverse is a "**fed**erated" "un**iverse**" of social network platforms that are able to talk to one another through a standard and open protocol. This means that you can consume content on any network from any of these networks. You are not locked to a single provider, you are free to choose. Please [watch this video](https://framatube.org/w/9dRFC6Ya11NCVeYKn8ZhiD?start=8s) by FramaSoft that illustrates the concept very good.
>

> Alternative frontends are good to protect your individual privacy. You can still consume the contents of privative and privacy-harmful services with protection over your privacy and some anonymity. Even using most these alternative frontends, still, the privative services will receive requests about the content you are consuming (even not knowing it is you). This sitll harms the collective privacy and adds data to their algorithms in some ways. Only the alternative frontends (or clients) that act as a proxy will hide your real IP from the content provider.

### Blogging platforms (Medium)

‚õî **Avoid**:
- **Medium** - website has Google trackers and ads.
- **Blogger** - Google owned, has google trackers and ads.

‚úÖ **Alternatives:**
- [Plume](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume) [üß©](#icons) - Federated blogging application, thanks to ActivityPub.
- [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/) [üß©](#icons) - An open source platform for building a writing space on the web.

‚úÖ **Alternative Medium frontends:**
- [Scribe](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/) - Medium alternative forntend inspired by Invidious.

### Instagram

[![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_219.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/219)

‚õî Don't use Instagram (or at least the official client). Instagram is a very privacy-invasive app with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic UI design.

‚úÖ **Instead use**

**Alternatives to Instagram**
- [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) [üß©](#icons) - Decentralized, federated and Open Source alternative to Instagram with posts, videos, stories, tags, etc.

### LBRY and Odysee

![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_2391.svg)

Odysee website contains some trackers and is a heavy site. You can use these alternatives to avoid trackers and have a more minimalistic and lightweight UI:

- [Librarian](https://codeberg.org/librarian/librarian) - An alternative frontend for LBRY/Odysee. Inspired by Invidious and Libreddit.

### Quora

‚õî Quora's website has ads and trackers that are used to get your data which is then sold/shared to third parties. Their [privacy policy](https://tosdr.org/en/service/314) is bad.

‚úÖ **Quora alternative frontends (web-based):**
- [Quetre](https://github.com/zyachel/quetre) - Quetre is an alternative front-end to Quora. It enables you to see answers without ads, trackers, and other such bloat.


### YouTube

[![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_274.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/274)

‚õî Don't use YouTube (or at least the official client). YouTube is very privacy invasive, it generates a very accurate profile based on your interests. Also it is a [radicalization tool](https://www.pcmag.com/news/does-youtubes-algorithm-lead-to-radicalization) which shows [biased content to users](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) in order to get more engagement and to get them to watch more and more content creating an [addiction](https://medium.com/dataseries/how-youtube-is-addictive-259d5c575883). It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. YouTube censors a lot. YouTube collects a LOT of your data: interests, free time, ideology, likes, dislikes, music taste, etc.

‚úÖ **Instead use**

### TikTok

[![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_1448.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/1448)

‚õî Avoid using TikTok, it is a toxic-designed application that harms not only the user privacy but also user integrity. You can take a read on [these several posts](https://libreddit.kavin.rocks/r/privacy/search?q=tiktok&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all).

‚úÖ **TikTok alternative frontends (web-based):**

### Twitter

[![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_195.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/195)

‚õî Avoid using Twitter official app / website. It tracks users and creates user profiles based on what they follow, retweet and like. Twitter harms and violates user privacy with their policies [by default](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/how-opt-out-twitters-new-privacy-settings). 

#### Self-hosted

- [Memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) - An open-source, self-hosted memo hub with knowledge management and socialization.

#### Decentralized

It doesn't rely on any trusted central server, hence it is resilient; it is based on cryptographic keys and signatures, so it is tamperproof; it does not rely on P2P techniques, therefore it works. **Note**: Nostr is a protocol, so it is capable of offering much more than a Twitter alternative.

> [!NOTE]
> **Federated social networks**: A federated social network isn't a single website like Twitter or Facebook, it's a network of thousands of communities operated by different organizations and individuals that provide a seamless social media experience.

### Streaming Platforms (Twitch)

[![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_200.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/200)

‚õî  Avoid using platforms as Twitch, Patreon, YouTube as they are very privacy-invasive with your viewers (and you!). Instead, you can try using some self-hosted platforms that do take care of everyone's privacy.

‚úÖ **Alternatives:**

## Video Editing
‚õî **Avoid**
- [![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_417.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/417)
- Sony Vegas
- DaVinci Resolve

## VPNs
‚õî **Avoid**

- [Free VPNs](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/) from Google Play or any appstore. These services are not free as they will suck your connections' data, keep logs and profile you to [sell your data to advertisers](https://thenextweb.com/news/be-cautious-free-vpns-are-selling-your-data-to-3rd-parties). If a government wants to track someone, such apps will be the first ones to fall.

- Closed source VPN apps such as Surfshark or NordVPN may be less trustworthy as nobody can be sure how they handle your data. Also, paying with Credit Card will get you identified on the payment. Furthermore, if you need to give your email it will also identify you if this same email has been used in other services.


‚úÖ  **Instead use**

Here are some open source and truly private (no personal data and/or credit card needed) options:

- [Azire](https://www.azirevpn.com/)

It comes with many privacy-invasive features, it is connected to your Google account most times. It is under [Google's privacy policy](https://tosdr.org/en/service/217) which is known to be very bad. Google is willing to enforce the [Manifest v3](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening) which is outright harmful to privacy efforts.
- **Microsoft Edge** - It's a Microsoft-themed version of Chromium with Microsoft trackers instead of Google ones. Under [Microsoft's privacy policy](https://tosdr.org/en/service/244), which is also very bad.

### Browser Addons

#### Anti-tracking

- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) - Free, open-source ad content blocker. Easy on CPU and memory.
	- [Read the extension docs](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) and pick one of the recommended modes to increase your privacy.

## Privacy vs Security vs Anonymity

Anonymity, Privacy, and Security are often used interchangeably, but they actually represent distinct concepts. It is important to understand the differences between them.

- Privacy is about regulating who has access to your personal information, being aware of the data that is being collected about you, and having the ability to decide who can access it and how. In short, privacy involves controlling your personal information.

- Security refers to safeguarding your personal information from unauthorized access or theft. It involves ensuring that your data is protected and stored in a secure manner, making it difficult for malicious actors to access it.

- Anonymity is about ensuring that your actions cannot be traced back to you. This means that even if someone discovers what you are doing, they will not be able to identify you as the source.

It is important to note that privacy and security are not necessarily interdependent. For instance, Google systems are secure and unlikely to be hacked, but Google still has access to your personal data and makes use of it. 

Privacy and anonymity are also not necessarily linked, services like Signal offer high levels of privacy since they do not collect any data about what you say, who you talk to or how you use the app, but they may not be anonymous since you still need to register using your phone number (which is in many cases linked to your identity).

Finally, there are services that may offer all three: anonymity, privacy, and security. The primary focus of this list is to provide alternatives that prioritize privacy. These alternatives give you control over your data and do not collect or sell it.
