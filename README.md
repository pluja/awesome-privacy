## Social Networks and Platforms

> Note: Alternative clients will share your IP with the service as they make direct requests.

### Instagram

Instagram is a very privacy-invasive app with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic UI design.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Instead use**

It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. YouTube censors a lot. YouTube collects a LOT of your data: interests, free time, ideology, likes, dislikes, music taste, etc.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Alternatives to Twitter:**
